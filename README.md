NeuralFIM
==============================

NeuralFIM is a neural network module for computing a Riemannian metric (fisher information metric) on point cloud data. In this repository we apply neuralFIM to point cloud data by visualizing PHATE embeddings of toy and single-cell datasets colored by the FIM trace and volume and use learned metrics fo find geodesics on the point cloud data. 

An example notebook for generating NeuralFIM embeddings exists [here](https://github.com/guillaumehu/phate_fim/blob/main/notebooks/df-test-neuralFIMv3.0).
An example notebook for finding geodesics using NeuralFIM exists [here](https://github.com/guillaumehu/phate_fim/blob/main/notebooks/df-test-neuralFIMv3.0).
